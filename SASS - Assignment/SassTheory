(1) Describe the benefits of using a CSS preprocessor like Sass or Less.
->1. Use of Variables :-  preprocessor allows developers to store values such as color,size,fonts &   space and use more than one time.
2.Nesting :- Nesting enables writing CSS that visually matches HTML structure. This improves readability and reduces repetitive selectors.
3.Mixins :- Mixins function like reusable blocks of code. Developers can define a styling pattern once and reuse it wherever needed.


(2)Explain variables, nesting, and mixins in Sass.
-> Variables :- Variables in Sass are used to store reusable values such as colors, font sizes, widths, or any other CSS value.
-> Nesting :- Nesting allows developers to write CSS rules in a hierarchical structure that mirrors the HTML structure. It reduces repetition and makes the code easier to read.
-> Mixins :- Mixins are reusable blocks of code that help avoid repetition. They can contain CSS properties and accept parameters, making them highly flexible.


(3)Describe the purpose of inheritance and partials in Sass.
-> Inheritance :- Inheritance in Sass allows one selector to inherit the styles of another using the @extend directive. This reduces duplication and ensures that common styling logic is shared efficiently across multiple elements.
-> Partials are used to break CSS into smaller, manageable files. This modular approach helps organize code better, especially in large projects.
